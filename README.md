# 👋 Hey, I'm Shohruh!

I'm a **Software & Data Engineer** from Uzbekistan with a strong drive to create practical, high-impact solutions through code. My core expertise lies in **backend development**, where I specialize in designing and building scalable, secure APIs and managing complex data pipelines.

With hands-on experience in frameworks like **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask**, I enjoy architecting systems that are not only functional but also robust and efficient. I work extensively with **PostgreSQL**, **Docker**, **Celery**, and **Redis** to build microservices-based platforms that scale smoothly and run reliably.

I'm also deeply curious about the future of technology, which has led me to explore **mobile development** and **IoT integration** — especially for smart, real-time systems like parking managers or automation tools. Beyond that, I'm passionate about clean architecture, DevOps best practices, and creating tools that truly serve their users.

Whether it's building a **school LMS**, launching a **startup**, or developing a **full-stack blog + portfolio website**, I'm always looking to level up and collaborate with like-minded developers across the world.
